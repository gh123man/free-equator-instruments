| Alto Sax   |  TBD       | [Alto_Sax.zip](https://github.com/gh123man/free-equator-instruments/releases/download/Sax-v1/Alto_Sax.zip)      | Inspired by and modeled to behave as close as possible to the SWAM alto sax seen in ROli's ads |

# About

This repo is designed to be a collection of realistic MPE instruments for Roli Equator often based on custom royalty free samples of actual instruments. [Roli advertises their products](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKSplgK5IEg) using "Actual" instrument sounds that end up being very expensive. I was disappointed to realize this and want to create a free solution. 

# Prerequisites

The FULL version of Roli Equator. Equator player is unsupported. 

These instructions assume you are using a mac. Windows should work fine but it has not been tested.

# Installation 

Go to the releases tab and download the instrument you want. The release zip includes its own installation instructions. 

# FAQ

Where are the samples? 
> The samples are not checked into the git repo as they take up a lot of space and are not text files. The samples will be bundled in the release you download. 

I have samples but cant figure out how to use them with equator?
> See Contributing below - or open an issue and send me the samples. If I have time I will create create the necessary sfz files and an instrument patch. 

I have patches that I want to share!
> Navigate to `~/Documents/ROLI/Equator/Presets` and copy submit the preset file as a pull request in the `Presets` folder of this repo. If your preset uses custom samples, please also submit the `sfz` files in the samples directory. 

# Contributing 

I am happy to accept contributions in the form of modifications to existing instruments or submissions of new ones. Please submit a pull request. If you have custom samples you want to include please mention that and we will get them bundled in the next release. 

If you have questions or comments that are not covered here - please open an issue.
